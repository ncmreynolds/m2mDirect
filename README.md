# m2mDirect
An Arduino library for connecting and maintaining a point-to-point connection between two (only) Espressif ESP8266/8285/32 microcontrollers with ESP-NOW. This library uses the inbuilt encryption features of ESP-NOW to provide a minimal level of privacy and attempts to ensure delivery of packets and monitor the quality of the connection.
